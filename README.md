# Mitosis

"Mitosis" is an attax clone for RISC OS, written in 100% Lua, using Gavin Wraith's excellent RiscLua package.

Perhaps of interest is the fact that Mitosis uses the RISC OS Toolbox (as opposed to event-based WIMP programming) by way of some nice toolbox wrapper classes. Also, it doesn't need Lua to run because it contains its own runtime via '!absolua'.
