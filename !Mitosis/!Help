How To Play
===========

Your goal is simple: End the game with more cells on the board than your opponent. To do so, you have to make sure that your cells *reproduce*. There are two different ways to achieve this:

1) If there's an empty space beside your cell (diagonal also counts!), you can jump there to split the cell in two seperate cells. That's called mitosis.

2) If you jump beside one or more cells of another colour, you'll *infect* those cells, effectively making them yours

You may also leap over one empty space (again, diagonal also counts). When doing so, your cell doesn't reproduce, but it may still infect other cells.

Have fun!
