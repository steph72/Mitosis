To run Mitosis directly from the sources:
1. make this directory the working directory
2. make sure the filer has seen the !Mitosis app (it should have, since you're here)
3. make sure you have RiscLua 5.70 installed and seen by the filer
4. double click "MIMain"

To build Mitosis as standalone application:
Follow steps 2-3 from above, and then double click "build". This will - if everything goes well - create a new !RunImage file which can be placed in the app folder.
